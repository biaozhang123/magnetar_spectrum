Code to model X-ray spectra of magnetar
====


## Compilation

To compile the code run:

```
make
```

## Procedure

The magnetosphere has to be solved first. In order to solve the equation for the twisted magnetosphere run:

```
python3 solve_twisted_magnetosphere.py 20 0.97 
```

where the first parameter is the degree of trigonometric polynomial used to expand the solution and the second parameter is p.
